\section{Introduction}\label{sec:introduction}

\subsection{Motivation/Overview}

With each passing day, more and more of our personal information is being collected, cataloged and analyzed by an ever increasing number of interested parties.
Their interests range from simple targeted advertising to malicious and sometimes illegal actions and everything in between.
We are the producers of this data, however, and we should be concerned with how it is being used.

For example, our medical records consist of very personal information which we reasonably expect to remain private.
Many countries have imposed regulations requiring a baseline of privacy for systems maintaining such sensitive information, e.g, the Health Insurance Portability and Acountability Act (HIPAA) in the USA.
However, the aggregation and availability of an entire populations medical records would be a huge boon for medical researchers in need of statistical data.
And so we are faced with a classic balancing act: how do we balance individuals' privacy against the usefulness of a dataset?

Differential privacy is an emerging field aiming to answer this question.
The central concept in differential privacy is indistinguishability, i.e, a query against a dataset should return more-or-less the same result regardless of whether or not a particular individuals records were included in the data.
If the results are indistinguishable, then the records of that particular individual must be unidentifiable.

Many metrics and algorithms have been developed by the differential privacy community.
Each algorithm is typically bundled with a formal proof that it meets some constraints or has some privacy-related properties.
The burden of producing such a proof is typically manual, and therefore error-prone.

PINQ is a differential privacy framework that takes a different approach.
It is a SQL-like query DSL for the .NET languages which guarantees differential privacy by construction.
Users of PINQ are able to use and compose carefully implemented primitives to build computations which run against raw data but cannot break differential privacy.
PINQ enforces checks for differential privacy at runtime.
We aim to show that it is possible to provide these privacy guarantees statically in a language with dependent types.

Strongly-typed languages are capable of statically verifying programs for type-correctness, precluding many potential sources of runtime errors: ``well-typed programs can't go wrong''.
We extend this notion of being ``well-typed'' to include differential privacy metrics.
Just as PINQ is embedded in the .NET languages (particularly C\#), we plan to embed our implementation within the dependently-typed language Idris (idris-lang.org).
This will allow us to take advantage of Idris' parser and advanced type checker as we explore the embedding of differential privacy metrics into a type-system.
(See the code snippet below for a motivation of sensitive functions in Idris).

\begin{lstlisting}
    data SensitiveFunction : Sensitivity -> Type where
      MkSensitiveFunction : (a -> b) -> SensitiveFunction s
\end{lstlisting}

Well-typed programs in our embedded language can't go wrong and also can't violate their privacy requirements.
Formal proofs for type-correct algorithms written in our language are unnecessary - the program is the proof!
Thus, all type-correct programs must respect expected privacy requirements.
